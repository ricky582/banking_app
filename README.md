# banking_app
A mock banking app, written in Java

## Inspiration
A group project from my 2nd year studies as part of my course CS217: Agile Software Engineering in Practice. Created from a set of [user stories](https://github.com/ricky582/banking_app/blob/master/UserStories.pdf) provided by the lab leaders. Tests were done in JUnit, and the UI was made using Jooby and Handlebars.

## Installation 
    1. Clone the repository
    2. Run the following in the command prompt of your choice:
        ./mvnw.cmd clean jooby:run
       Alternatively, on IntelliJ, you can navigate to Maven, open asep-bank/Plugins/jooby/jooby:run
       
## Building
    ./mvnw.cmd clean package

## Testing
Tests can be found in src/test/java/uk/co/asepstrath/bank
